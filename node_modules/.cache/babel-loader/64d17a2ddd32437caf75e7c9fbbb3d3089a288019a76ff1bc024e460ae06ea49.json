The value of the NFTs as well as your ability to access and transfer NFTs could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risk factors materialize. As a result, when you mint and purchase NFTs you expose yourself to considerable risk and potential financial losses. Please also note that this Risk Statement is not exhaustive. You should carry out further research (and seek professional advice) to carefully determine whether purchasing and/or trading NFTs is suitable for your particular financial situation and risk tolerance. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED BY YOU RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OUR PLATFORM OR FROM YOUR PURCHASE, TRANSFER OR USE OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS. NFTS ARE COMMODITY ASSETS AND YOU SHOULD NEVER USE FUNDS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE TO PURCHASE NFTS. 1. PRICE VOLATILITY The price of NFTs can be subject to dramatic valuations due to the rapid shifts in offer and demand resulting from events such as but not limited to: (a) good or bad publicity, (b) changes in the financial technology industry, (c) technological advancement, (d) market trends, (e) general economic and/or political conditions, (f) degree of adoption, (g) degree of institutional support, (h) regulatory measures, (i) degree of government support, (l) market dynamics, (m) trading activities, (n) hacking, and (o) events affecting large service providers, including exchanges. AS A RESULT OF PRICE VOLATILITY, YOUR NFTS MAY LOSE ALL VALUE AND BECOME WORTHLESS. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF THE INHERENT PRICE-VOLATILITY OF NFTS. 2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC WALLETS NFTs are stored on cryptographic wallets (\\\"Wallets\\\"). A private key (for example, a passphrase) is usually necessary to access, control and/or dispose of tokens that are stored in your Wallet. Losing access to the private key(s) associated with your Wallet may result in the permanent loss of your ability to access and dispose of your tokens. You are solely responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropriate measures for securing access to your private key(s) and Wallet. WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY WALLET SERVICES OR PRODUCTS. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET AND/OR PRIVATE KEYS. 3. PROTOCOLS NFTs are recorded on distributed ledgers (typically shared across networks of users) which are governed by, subject to, and distinguished on the basis of certain set of rules known as protocols. In addition to distributed ledgers, secondary and third-party managed exchange networks also operate protocols integrated with requisite distributed ledgers. 3.1 Malfunction, breakdown and/or abandonment of protocols Any malfunction, breakdown, and/or abandonment of the protocols (and of any consensus mechanism, where applicable) on which the NFTs are based could severely affect the price of the NFTs as well as your ability to dispose of the NFTs (particularly where the protocol relies on substantial participation and wide networks to operate properly). 3.2 Mining attacks Some protocols integrate consensus-based mechanisms for the validation of transfers (\\u201CConsensus Protocols\\u201D). Consensus Protocols are, therefore, susceptible to attacks at the stage of validation, where token transactions are approved by the network. This may affect the accuracy of transactions occurring on the protocol, and transfer mechanisms of your NFTs. 3.3 Hacking and security weaknesses NFTs may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Bad actors (including hackers, groups, and organizations) may attempt to interfere with the protocols (such as Ethereum Virtual Machine software and token interfaces) or the smart contracts in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, some protocols are based on open-source software and, as a result, subject to the risk of weakness being introduced to the protocols (either willingly or accidentally) at the development stage. Any such weakness may be exploited by bad actors for the purposes of misappropriating your NFTs, or otherwise affect the functionality of the protocol and of your ability to dispose of your NFTs. WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PROTOCOLS. AS SUCH, WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOLS. 4. LAWS AND REGULATIONS The legal and/or regulatory framework surrounding NFTs and distributed ledger technology is uncertain, not harmonized, and unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict what framework will become applicable to NFTs in the near future and how the implementation of dedicated legal and/or regulatory frameworks will affect the value and utilization of NFTs. A newly introduced legal and regulatory framework may interfere with or otherwise limit your ability to hold or dispose of your NFTs, which in turn could result in a financial loss on your part. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF ANY NEWLY INTRODUCED LEGAL AND/OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. 5. TAXATION The tax characterization of NFTs is complex and largely uncertain. The uncertainty in the tax treatment of NFTs may expose you to unforeseen future tax consequences associated with purchasing, owning, selling or otherwise using NFTs. You should seek tax advice to understand what tax obligations apply to you when purchasing, holding, transferring, and utilizing NFTs. Failure to comply with your tax obligations could result in severe fines and even jail time. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR OTHER FORM OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY TAX LIABILITY THAT IS OR WILL BE APPLICABLE TO YOU. 6. UNANTICIPATED RISKS In addition to the risks included in this document, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding, trading, and use of NFTs, some of which we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this section. THIS RISK STATEMENT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE AND SHALL NOT BE TAKEN TO ENCOMPASS ALL RISKS INVOLVED IN THE PURCHASE, HOLDING, TRADING AND USE OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS SUFFERED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF UNANTICIPATED RISKS.\"\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 23,\n                columnNumber: 17\n              }, this)]\n            }, void 0, true, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 12,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 11,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Col, {\n            xl: 12,\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Accordion.Item, {\n              style: {\n                marginTop: \"40px\",\n                fontFamily: \"Avenir\",\n                textAlign: \"start\"\n              },\n              eventKey: \"0\",\n              children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Accordion.Header, {\n                style: {\n                  // marginBottom: \"94px\",\n                  fontFamily: \"Avenir\"\n                },\n                children: \"PRIVACY POLICY\"\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 152,\n                columnNumber: 17\n              }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Accordion.Body, {\n                children: \"Last Updated: 15 April, 2024 This Privacy Policy describes the types of information The Atrium LCA, together with our affiliates and assigns (collectively, \\u201Cwe\\u201D or \\u201CThe Atrium\\u201D) collect on the Platforms (defined below), how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

The value of the\n                  NFTs as well as your ability to access and transfer NFTs could\n                  be materially and adversely affected if any of these risk\n                  factors materialize. As a result, when you mint and purchase\n                  NFTs you expose yourself to considerable risk and potential\n                  financial losses. Please also note that this Risk Statement is\n                  not exhaustive. You should carry out further research (and\n                  seek professional advice) to carefully determine whether\n                  purchasing and/or trading NFTs is suitable for your particular\n                  financial situation and risk tolerance. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE\n                  FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED BY YOU RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OUR\n                  PLATFORM OR FROM YOUR PURCHASE, TRANSFER OR USE OF\n                  NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS. NFTS ARE COMMODITY ASSETS AND YOU SHOULD\n                  NEVER USE FUNDS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE TO PURCHASE\n                  NFTS. 1. PRICE VOLATILITY The price of NFTs can be subject to\n                  dramatic valuations due to the rapid shifts in offer and\n                  demand resulting from events such as but not limited to: (a)\n                  good or bad publicity, (b) changes in the financial technology\n                  industry, (c) technological advancement, (d) market trends,\n                  (e) general economic and/or political conditions, (f) degree\n                  of adoption, (g) degree of institutional support, (h)\n                  regulatory measures, (i) degree of government support, (l)\n                  market dynamics, (m) trading activities, (n) hacking, and (o)\n                  events affecting large service providers, including exchanges.\n                  AS A RESULT OF PRICE VOLATILITY, YOUR NFTS MAY LOSE ALL VALUE\n                  AND BECOME WORTHLESS. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS\n                  INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF THE INHERENT PRICE-VOLATILITY\n                  OF NFTS. 2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC WALLETS NFTs are stored on\n                  cryptographic wallets (\"Wallets\"). A private key (for example,\n                  a passphrase) is usually necessary to access, control and/or\n                  dispose of tokens that are stored in your Wallet. Losing\n                  access to the private key(s) associated with your Wallet may\n                  result in the permanent loss of your ability to access and\n                  dispose of your tokens. You are solely responsible for\n                  implementing all reasonable and appropriate measures for\n                  securing access to your private key(s) and Wallet. WE DO NOT\n                  PROVIDE ANY WALLET SERVICES OR PRODUCTS. WE SHALL NOT BE\n                  RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM YOUR INABILITY TO\n                  ACCESS YOUR WALLET AND/OR PRIVATE KEYS. 3. PROTOCOLS NFTs are\n                  recorded on distributed ledgers (typically shared across\n                  networks of users) which are governed by, subject to, and\n                  distinguished on the basis of certain set of rules known as\n                  protocols. In addition to distributed ledgers, secondary and\n                  third-party managed exchange networks also operate protocols\n                  integrated with requisite distributed ledgers. 3.1\n                  Malfunction, breakdown and/or abandonment of protocols Any\n                  malfunction, breakdown, and/or abandonment of the protocols\n                  (and of any consensus mechanism, where applicable) on which\n                  the NFTs are based could severely affect the price of the NFTs\n                  as well as your ability to dispose of the NFTs (particularly\n                  where the protocol relies on substantial participation and\n                  wide networks to operate properly). 3.2 Mining attacks Some\n                  protocols integrate consensus-based mechanisms for the\n                  validation of transfers (“Consensus Protocols”). Consensus\n                  Protocols are, therefore, susceptible to attacks at the stage\n                  of validation, where token transactions are approved by the\n                  network. This may affect the accuracy of transactions\n                  occurring on the protocol, and transfer mechanisms of your\n                  NFTs. 3.3 Hacking and security weaknesses NFTs may be subject\n                  to expropriation and/or theft. Bad actors (including hackers,\n                  groups, and organizations) may attempt to interfere with the\n                  protocols (such as Ethereum Virtual Machine software and token\n                  interfaces) or the smart contracts in a variety of ways,\n                  including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of\n                  service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks,\n                  smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, some protocols are based\n                  on open-source software and, as a result, subject to the risk\n                  of weakness being introduced to the protocols (either\n                  willingly or accidentally) at the development stage. Any such\n                  weakness may be exploited by bad actors for the purposes of\n                  misappropriating your NFTs, or otherwise affect the\n                  functionality of the protocol and of your ability to dispose\n                  of your NFTs. WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PROTOCOLS. AS\n                  SUCH, WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS ARISING OUT OF\n                  OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOLS. 4. LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n                  The legal and/or regulatory framework surrounding NFTs and\n                  distributed ledger technology is uncertain, not harmonized,\n                  and unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to\n                  predict what framework will become applicable to NFTs in the\n                  near future and how the implementation of dedicated legal\n                  and/or regulatory frameworks will affect the value and\n                  utilization of NFTs. A newly introduced legal and regulatory\n                  framework may interfere with or otherwise limit your ability\n                  to hold or dispose of your NFTs, which in turn could result in\n                  a financial loss on your part. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY\n                  LOSS WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF ANY NEWLY INTRODUCED\n                  LEGAL AND/OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. 5. TAXATION The tax\n                  characterization of NFTs is complex and largely uncertain. The\n                  uncertainty in the tax treatment of NFTs may expose you to\n                  unforeseen future tax consequences associated with purchasing,\n                  owning, selling or otherwise using NFTs. You should seek tax\n                  advice to understand what tax obligations apply to you when\n                  purchasing, holding, transferring, and utilizing NFTs. Failure\n                  to comply with your tax obligations could result in severe\n                  fines and even jail time. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS\n                  OR OTHER FORM OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION\n                  WITH YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY TAX LIABILITY THAT IS OR\n                  WILL BE APPLICABLE TO YOU. 6. UNANTICIPATED RISKS In addition\n                  to the risks included in this document, there are other risks\n                  associated with your purchase, holding, trading, and use of\n                  NFTs, some of which we cannot anticipate. Such risks may\n                  further materialize as unanticipated variations or\n                  combinations of the risks discussed in this section. THIS RISK\n                  STATEMENT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE AND SHALL NOT BE TAKEN TO\n                  ENCOMPASS ALL RISKS INVOLVED IN THE PURCHASE, HOLDING, TRADING\n                  AND USE OF NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR\n                  LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS SUFFERED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF\n                  UNANTICIPATED RISKS.\n                </Accordion.Body>\n              </Accordion.Item>\n            </Col>\n            <Col xl={12}>\n              <Accordion.Item\n                style={{\n                  marginTop: \"40px\",\n                  fontFamily: \"Avenir\",\n                  textAlign: \"start\",\n                }}\n                eventKey={\"0\"}\n              >\n                <Accordion.Header\n                  style={{\n                  \n                    // marginBottom: \"94px\",\n                    fontFamily: \"Avenir\",\n                  }}\n                >\n                  PRIVACY POLICY\n                </Accordion.Header>\n                <Accordion.Body >\n                  Last Updated: 15 April, 2024 This Privacy Policy describes the\n                  types of information The Atrium LCA, together with our\n                  affiliates and assigns (collectively, “we” or “The Atrium”)\n                  collect on the Platforms (defined below), how we use such\n                  information and to whom and under what circumstances we may\n                  disclose it.

In addition, we may collect\n                  information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and\n                  time you visit the Platforms, the areas or pages of the\n                  Platforms that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing\n                  the Platforms, the number of times you return to the Platforms\n                  and other clickstream data. If you do not want us to collect\n                  information about your geographic location, you must disable\n                  the technology that transmits this information. We may also\n                  use non-personal or aggregated information for statistical\n                  analysis, research, and other purposes. Like many commercial\n                  websites, we analyze how visitors use our Platforms through\n                  what is known as \"cookie\" technology or similar tracking\n                  tools. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your\n                  computer when you access the Platforms and allows us to\n                  recognize you each time you visit the Platforms. We may use\n                  cookies to: (1) allow you to use the Platforms without having\n                  to re-enter your username and password; (2) enhance or\n                  personalize your Site usage and shopping experience; (3)\n                  monitor Site usage; (4) manage the Platforms; and (5) improve\n                  the Platforms and our products and services. If you choose,\n                  you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually\n                  delete individual cookies or all of the cookies on your\n                  computer by following your browser’s help file directions.\n                  However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you\n                  manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing\n                  and using some of the pages and features that are currently on\n                  our Platforms, or that we may put on our Platforms in the\n                  future. Note that browser-management tools for cookies are\n                  outside of our control and we cannot guarantee their\n                  effectiveness. If you continue to use the Platforms without\n                  changing your settings, you consent to our use of cookies and\n                  other tools on the Platforms. We may combine the information\n                  we collect through cookies, web beacons, or other technology\n                  tools with other information we have collected from you or\n                  information from other sources. Strictly Necessary Cookies\n                  These cookies are necessary for the website to function and\n                  cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only\n                  set in response to actions made by you which amount to a\n                  request for services, such as setting your privacy\n                  preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your\n                  browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some\n                  parts of the Platforms may then not work properly. These\n                  cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.\n                  Performance Cookies These cookies allow us to count visits and\n                  traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance\n                  of the Platforms. They help us to know which pages are the\n                  most and least popular and see how visitors move around the\n                  Platforms. All information these cookies collect is aggregated\n                  and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we\n                  will not know when you have visited the Platforms and will not\n                  be able to monitor its performance. Functional Cookies These\n                  cookies enable the Platforms to provide enhanced functionality\n                  and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party\n                  providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do\n                  not allow these cookies, then the Platforms may not function\n                  properly. Targeting Cookies These cookies may be set through\n                  the Sites or Platforms by our advertising partners. They may\n                  be used by those companies to build a profile of your\n                  interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. These\n                  cookies uniquely identify your browser and device. If you do\n                  not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted\n                  advertising.
